# 📚 Lessons Learned Documentation

## Purpose

This folder contains critical lessons learned from development challenges, mistakes, and their solutions. The goal is to prevent recurring issues and share knowledge across the team.

## 🎯 How to Use This Documentation

1. **Before Starting Major Refactoring**: Review relevant lessons learned
2. **When Encountering Issues**: Check if similar problems have been solved before
3. **After Resolving Complex Issues**: Document the lesson learned for future reference
4. **During Code Reviews**: Reference lessons learned to validate approaches

## 📋 Current Lessons Learned
